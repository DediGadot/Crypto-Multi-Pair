## 🎯 Key Information Added

### Performance Metrics

| System | Speedup |
|--------|---------|
| 4-core | 2.1x |
| 8-core | 4.9x |
| 16-core | 10.6x |

### Commands Reference

**Portfolio Optimization:**
```bash
# Quick (3-5 min)
uv run python optimize_portfolio_parallel.py --quick

# Full optimization
uv run python optimize_portfolio_parallel.py --workers auto

# Verify
uv run python test_parallel_proof.py
```

**Using Optimized Config:**
```bash
uv run python run_full_pipeline.py \
  --portfolio \
  --config optimization_results/optimized_config.yaml \
  --report
```

### Walk-Forward Validation

Explained how it prevents overfitting:
```
Timeline: |--Window 1--|--Window 2--|--Window 3--|--Window 4--|

Split 1: Train(W1) → Test(W2)
Split 2: Train(W1+W2) → Test(W3)
Split 3: Train(W1+W2+W3) → Test(W4)
```

### Key Metrics

- **Test Outperformance**: Primary metric (how much better than buy-and-hold)
- **Test Win Rate**: Reliability indicator (>60% is good)
- **Generalization Gap**: Overfitting check (<5% is excellent)
- **Robustness**: Consistency across time periods
